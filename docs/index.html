        <h2>Project: Rush00</h2>
        <p>
          This project consisted on creating a grid with a custom input size. so
          for example, an input of (5,3) would display:
        </p>
        <img src="rush00 ex00.PNG" alt="expected result" />
        <p>In ex01, the same input would display:</p>
        <img src="rush00 ex01.PNG" alt="expected result" />

        <div class="Try">
          <h2>Try it yourself!</h2>
